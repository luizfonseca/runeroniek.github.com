        Yep. I started this stuff called programming in November, 2009 and I couldn't stop so far. I love it

        I started with PHP, and then C (not much as I would expect :/) and Java (it's a cool language, regardless the fact I don't care about languages at all). Then I have a date with Python, but felt in love with Ruby too.
